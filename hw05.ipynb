This makes sense because due to the MRF being located notably farther than the other two facilities, the transportation costs are high, and there would be the additional costs that arise from handling residual waste from the MRF. Another check that confirms the solution makes sense is that for each city, the sum of the waste being sent to disposal sites equals the amount of waste generated per day in each city. For example, for City 3, 79 Mg/d is sent to LF and 41 Mg/d is sent to WTE. The total waste disposed is 120 Mg/d, which is equal to the amount of waste produced by City 3. Also, the residual waste from WTE to LF is supposed to be 16% of the incoming waste to WTE. According to this solution, the total amount of incoming waste to WTE is 131 Mg/d, and 16% of that is about 21 Mg/d, which is the solution for $R_{31}$."

Thus, under the carbon tax scenario, having the second landfill is a part of the MSW disposal plan that results in the optimized minimal cost. Additionally, given the price increase for WTE, it makes sense that we're significantly reducing the amount disposed at WTE and diverting the disposal to LF2. However, additional considerations, such as the ecological cost associated with converting land to a landfill and stakeholder/public buy-in, should be taken into account in making the decision.  "
